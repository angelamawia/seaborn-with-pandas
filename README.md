# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Texas Death Row Inmate Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset focused on inmates in Texas who were on death row prior to their executions in 2018. The dataset provides insights into various aspects of the inmates' backgrounds, including their last statements, education levels, and racial demographics.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains the following columns:
- **Age at Execution**: The age of the inmate at the time of execution.
- **Highest Education Level**: The highest level of education attained by the inmate.
- **Race**: The racial background of the inmate.
- **Last Statement**: The final words spoken by the inmate before execution.

## Analysis
The analysis performed includes:

### 1. **Education Level Distribution**
A count plot visualizes the highest education levels attained by inmates. The findings highlight the educational background of those on death row, revealing significant disparities.

### 3. **Education vs. Age Scatter Plot**
A scatter plot examines the relationship between education levels and ages at execution, colored by race, revealing patterns and insights into how these factors may relate.

### 4. **Racial Demographics**
The distribution of inmates by race is visualized through bar charts, highlighting racial disparities in the death row population.

### 5. **Pairwise Relationships**
A pairplot provides insights into relationships between multiple variables, allowing for a deeper understanding of correlations within the dataset.

## Key Findings
- The majority of inmates on death row have lower levels of formal education.
- Age at execution varies, with noticeable peaks at certain age groups.
- Racial demographics show significant disparities, with certain races being overrepresented.

## Conclusion
This EDA provides valuable insights into the profiles of inmates on death row in Texas. The visualizations and analyses can aid in understanding the socio-economic and racial factors contributing to the death penalty.

## Future Work
Further analyses could include:
- A time series analysis of executions over the years.
- A deeper exploration of the relationship between socio-economic status and sentencing.
